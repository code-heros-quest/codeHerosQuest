# CODE HEROS QUEST: battle-for-the-kingdom

## Midterm project

Description of scope of project

Today we are spoiled for choices when it comes to computer entertainment. We have games consoles like the XBOX and Playstation offering up 4k hyper-real graphics with immersive sound sitting under our TV sets. We also have virtual reality experiences that immerse us entirely in graphics and sound with headsets, augmented reality where we overlay graphics onto the real world, and we have mixed reality with headsets likes the Halolens. These are all well and good, but we can go even higher resolution using the most powerful graphics engine ever invented; your imagination!

With that, I present this game engine called the “Code Heroes Quest.” Ever since Humans could communicate in writing, we have been using the power of the written word to tell stories and fire up the imagination. Back in the 1980s making fiction more interactive was popularized with text adventure computer games where you get to play and explore a virtual world purely through text on the screen. At the time computers were very underpowered and could not display lots of graphics, but as graphic based computer games became more popular the humble text adventure started fading into the background, but they never went away, and there are still a lot of people who enjoy playing them as well as making them.

The Code Heroes Quest is an easy to use, object-oriented game framework The engine is developed in Javascript, Node.js; which means games can be played in the console window.
