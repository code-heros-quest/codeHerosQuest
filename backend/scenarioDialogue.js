    intro: 'In the beginning, the people welcomed a rich and powerful lord as their king, not knowing that the he would take over the land and bring famine and disease to the people. He taxed the poor and spared the rich. He built walls, really tall walls, around the kingdom to keep out the surrounding nations. Due to the King’s rule, villainous monsters have moved in and flourish in the kingdom. They prey on the poor villagers. Emboldened by the King’s tyranny, the monsters have come out of hiding to rain terror upon the land. A secret rebellion has formed amongst the kingdom’s villages. A messenger has been sent to sneak out of the kingdom and find your legendary band of warriors, to plea for your aid in overturning the evil kings reign.',
    atTheWall: `Having received the villagers plea and deciding to answer their cries, your motley band of mighty warriors travels for days and finally you see the walls of the kingdom before you. ${char.warrior.name} jokes “Only a small man would build such tall walls!” ${char.assassin.name} replies “definitely overcompensating for something…” As the hulking walls get closer you begin to see what appears to be an Orc Lord guarding a gate.`,
    theOrcLord: 'Your team decides the best way through a wall is over the dead body of an Orc so you prepare for battle.',
    theOldFriend: `You make your way into the kingdom, surprised that their aren’t guards stationed more closely together. The area immediately surrounding the gate entrance is a sort of mini hub with a small inn and stable. Surprisingly no one has come out to see what the commotion was, but perhaps they are used to hearing the guard engage in battle. Eventually a change of guards will occur and someone will notice a dead Orc captain laying across the entrance to the kingdom. For now you decide it’s best to get as far into the countryside as possible where you won’t come into contact with the perimeter patrols. As you are walking past the inn you hear a shout, “hey! You there! Ogre!”. A robust man of a somewhat small stature comes towards you and calls out to ${char.warrior.name} by name. “Well I haven’t seen you since the battle of Meridorl! How you doin old pal?! Still bashing in brains I see” the loud man says with a quick glance at ${char.warrior.name}’s new Mace. ${char.hunter.name} interrupts and proclaims loudly “I am sorry sir but you must be thinking of someone else! We don’t know you or have any idea what you are referring too!” He makes large eyes and a shushing gesture at the man. The man looks bewildered and starts back up, clearly a ways in to his cups “Sure you know me! Why remember the time that we-“ Just at that moment ${char.wizard.name} puts a silence spell on the man, and not a second too soon. A small group of soldiers is visible walking the inner perimeter of the wall towards you. The man puts his hands to his mouth with panic in his eyes, clearly trying to speak, though no words are coming out. Ogre wraps his big arm around the mans shoulder and you nonchalantly guide the man down the street away from the guards. ${char.wizard.name} says to the man “I am going to take the spell off but you need to be very quiet. We need to get out of here before those guards realize there is anything wrong. Is there somewhere you can take us?” The now quiet man seems to catch on and looks at them shrewdly before nodding. ${char.wizard.name} removes the spell without the slightest gesture and the man, having gotten his voice back, whispers “this way” and leads you down an alley. “We are going to have to run. It is quite a while before the edge of the woods where we won’t be in the sight line of the perimeter guard.” He seems to have sobered up quite a bit with the shock of being unable to speak for a while. ${char.assassin.name} says “lead the way”, and you all take off at a run.`,
    theWoodsman: `Your team decides you aren’t prepared for a fight with a full blown Orc Lord today. You are short on supplies and the team lost several weapons in your last big battle which will need to be replaced. You head west into the woods before the near-sighted Orc sees your group, and make your way towards a less guarded area. Up ahead a man is chopping wood. He is not wearing a royal insignia, and looks thin and tired. Your group decides to approach him and ask if he knows a way into the kingdom that might be less conspicuous. You send ${char.wizard.name} to talk to him since the Wizard is the least visibly threatening of the group but quite capable of wielding a healing staff as a weapon if necessary. The exhausted axe armed man approaches your group with ${char.wizard.name} at his side. As he gets closer you see he has dark circles around his eyes and sunken in cheeks. He tells your group “I live inside the kingdom walls and sneak out every day to collect wood for my family to trade with the rest of my village. No one has much food, but they are will to trade some of what the have for a warm fire in the hearth. If you are brave enough to face down our evil king I am brave enough to sneak you through the wall”  You all collect firewood as the man finishes his chopping and follow him back to the wall. He shows you a hole hidden by a bush and you are all able to fit through, even ${char.warrior.name} with enough wiggle to make a barmaid blush. You follow him back to his village and thank him for the safe passage”`,
    theVillage: `You arrive to the village and are introduced to some members of the rebellion. One approaches and says "Hello friends, my name is Talon. I am one of the members of the rebellion that had sent word to request for your help... My people have been taxed, starved and preyed upon for too long by this tyrant we call a King. If we do not make a stand now, I fear we will no longer have the strength to seize another chance." After a few minutes of discussing the details of the rebellion's past failed plans, your group of warriors meets others in the village and you have an evening meal with the woodsman and his wife. In the morning you get information from the group of village rebels about a contact in the city surrounding the palace. You are told your contact will be expecting you in a tavern called the "Horned Animal". ${char.assassin.name} and ${char.warrior.name} snicker at the name, while ${char.hunter.name} takes note of the code phrase that will authenticate your identities with your contact. Talon says "Before you leave... I am wary of asking more from you, as you are already taking on an impossible task, but desperation has left me no choice but to ask. This village has been plagued by a Goblin, a foul beast that has been taking the village children. It started off only hunting during the night, but the attacks have become bolder and more frequent. The single goblin has become a pack and is now hunting during broad day light. We had gathered a few warriors, a total of 12 of our most capable men and attempted to apprehend these creatures but, only 2 of us made it back alive. Myself included. We have no other way of defeating these monsters. We have been keeping them at bay by leaving out our harvest so they won't take our children.`,
    thePoisonousBite: `Your team starts their travel on the horse paved road, which stretches for miles. After an hour into your travel, the shrubs that lay on each side of the road reach the height of your shoulders. The path starts to narrow just a bit more and you now must form a single line to walk through. Suddenly, everyone seems edgy and you become cautious. The sound of thousands of insects begins rattling through the air. You all start to run to get out of the tall bushed walls that stretch for another mile or two. As you are sprinting to make it to the clearing, large insects start leaping out of the bushes towards the you. Near the clearing, one of the insects lunges out and latches itself onto ${char.warrior.name}'s neck! Another lunges and attaches itself onto ${char.warrior.name}'s ankle. Finally, after making it to the clearing, ${char.warrior.name} rips off the insects, along with some flesh. The effect on ${char.warrior.name} veins that surround the wound make it evident the insects are poisonous.
    ${char.wizard.name} says "It should be ok. Ogre blood is thick and slow enough that the poison will not survive. We will need to stop and rest for the night in this clearing though.`,
    theGoblin: `As you step out from the borders of the village to the path heading south, your team senses something is not right. All of a sudden, the ground shakes beneath your feet and from a distance you see a group of hideous creatures, ludicrously grotesque both in face and form, drawing closer towards you. The woodsman yells "The Goblin is back and he brought others! Run back to your homes, children and mothers. Do not be anxious! We have prepared enough supplies from the last harvest to offer to them."
    Your team looks at one another with determination in your eyes. You are ready to fight, prepared to end this madness once and for all.`,
    theTroll: `Deep into your journey towards the king’s castle, your warrior band, already feeling the effects of your travels, comes upon a bridge. You see a pile of rubish and ${char.warrior.name} walks over to check it out. He smiles and says "Look!" Holding up a handful of small vials with a shimmering liquid inside. In that moment a massive Troll presents himself. Standing tall, in your path of crossing, he demands in his heavy troll like rasp, “Who dares take my riches?!”. Startled but always ready for battle, your group gathers and prepares for a battle with the giant standing before you.`,
    forkInTheRoad: `After a long and grueling battle with the troll, your band of warriors moves forward on your journey to dethrone the king. It has been raining all day and you have to pull your boots out of the mud with every step. You trudge onward until the sky turns dark. ${char.hunter.name} says "I would send the hawk up to look ahead but I haven't been able to train her yet without any jesses". While this seems like a useless thing to mention, it is a good point. You need to make your way to a town where you can restock on provisions. You decide you will need to make camp for the night just as you arrive at a fork in the road. You almost miss the sign posted because the rain is so heavy you can barely see through it. The sign has two arms, one pointing to the north, and one pointing to the south. The northern arm has what looks to be gold coins carved on it, the southern has a hammer. By morning you will have to decide which route to take. Coins could mean a market, you could replentish your food and bandages, but north is not the way to the castle. The hammer could mean a forge, perhaps a good chance to purchase new armor or weapons?`,
    theMerchant: `Luckily, you awake to a clear blue sky and start the day at a much more rapid pace than the previous one. Traveling down the path to the north you begin to hear something. A rickety old wagon with the sounds of glass and metal clanking is being pushed along. There is a merchant draped in a long-torn robe, consisting of mostly patches and holes with the traveling store. As you approach the merchant, ${char.assassin.name} asks what he has for sale. Immediately the merchant introduces himself and tells the you that he knows of each of you well. “Once I was one of the most respected dealers throughout the kingdom, but due to the king’s laws I am no longer able to receive new items from outside the kingdom’s walls. I have become nothing more than a poor peasant along with the rest. For my safety I dare not sell to you. If you continue down the road north there is a large town with a daily market. On the seventh-day many craftspeople from the area visit to set up stalls and sell their goods. I have not been there in a long time, but surely you would be able to restock your supplies there. I can not SELL to you, but if you answer a riddle that I have seen no other answer, I will reward you with a token.`,
    tinTown: `At midday the next day your group finds itself approaching a dusty assortment of tents and scrap houses that stretches a ways into the distance. ${char.assassin.name} asks in a incredulous tone "Someone please tell me this isn't the market town..." Looking out over the encampment you see piles of trash, and what looks like abandoned shelters that have fallen into dereliction.  ${char.wizard.name} replies "If it is we may be in serious trouble. We are nearly out of food." You make your way down into the sea of lean-to's and fabric walls. The area seems to be seperated into "camps" where people are residing. The first clump of shelters you pass has a boundary of sharpened sticks lined up around it like a fence. It doesn't look the most inviting so you decide to move on. Ahead on the right you are approaching a collection of what appears to be conical huts made of some type of grass thatching. There is a small group of people out front of the camp washing up in wooden buckets. As you get closer you see they are cleaning fabric, maybe clothing. ${char.hunter.name} decides to hail them, "Hello! You there! We are weary travelers looking for a place to get a meal. Do you know where we might find a market or inn?" One of the washers, an older suspicious looking woman eyes the bow and hawk warily but replies, "We don't want any trouble here, if you are looking for mischief go seek the Strikers-camp or Ricketsville. Aye, they'll give ya a fight." "No, ma'am", the slender Elf assurs her, "We be not looking for a fight, simply food and maybe some cloth supplies." Still looking cautious she seems to be willing to give you more information. "We have nothing to spare here, we don't keep anything we can't defend... but you may find someone willing to sell a few eggs or a bit of bread further in. Sometimes a cartman makes his way out here with a bit of butter to trade." `,
    curiosityKilledTheCat: `${char.hunter.name} makes another attempt to speak to the woman but she is unwilling to talk and hurries off into one of the dome shaped huts. In a high, almost comically creepy voice, you hear "Curiosity killed the cat, don't you know?" Looking to your right you see a small spindly middle aged man scratching lines into the dirt with a stick. He is the only one of the group not doing any washing. He is also the only one that seems capable of speach so perhaps you should humor the man, even though he makes your hair stand on end. ${char.assassin.name} slides to the front of your group and seems to be palming a small sharp knife. The Assassin replies to the weird man "An animal with nine lives can afford to be curious." The man lets out a mad cackle and favors your party with a frightening grin. ${char.assassin.name} asks, "Perhaps you can tell us what this place is, what happened here?" He seems willing to oblige, you guess not many people are willing to talk to him. "Well as for what this is? Why the last free place in the Kingdom! No rules, no masters, no gaurd. The only place to live outside of the King's law." He looks gleeful as he says these words. "Tin Town used to be a prosperous place, markets and merchants, but the King never has enough, does he? He just kept taking more and more until the merchants couldn't afford to make new baubles and the coins ran out. When the money left the gaurds left and they don't care much now what happens to us." Another mad cackle keeps him busy a few minutes and you start to think it might be time to leave. Then he starts talking again "Without the guards we are free but you only keep what you hold. There are some crazy people here! They will kill to take what they want or burn you out!" That explains the wall of sharpened sticks around the last camp. ${char.wizard.name} starts to speak and the mad man seems to calm a little. "Is there no place we can go here to barter or trade for food or supplies?" The spindly man smiles beatifically and says " The Neutral Zone, in the center, no no no fights in there, no no no..." The Wizard might have put on a little too much charm because the man seems to just be chanting "no no no..." in a sing song voice now.`,
    neutralZone: `As you wander down the path towards the center of the encampment you see more strange groups of dwellings. On the left is a camp built on stilts. Every tent is set up on a platform raised up twice the height of a human from the ground on stilts. There are ropes coiled on the platforms that you suppose must be used to climb up and down. Each platform has a narrow beam between it and it's neighbor acting as a path from tent to tent. On the right is a camp with no visible defense, but by the looks of the inhabitants shuffling around inside you can see it doesn't need a guard. There are humans and half ogres obviously under the influence of some kind of strong drug. Some of the camps inhabitants are passed out on the ground, clearly right where they fell over, and others are pacing around ranting and mumbling. Their homes are little more than blankets strewn about and some piles of debris that have been built into cave like mounds. No right minded person would enter their domain. You pass many more odd assortments of people but no one seems very willing to talk. Eventually you make it to a clearing with a large parade tent in the center. It is round and domed and seems like it could hold at least 100 people at capacity. There is a crude sign posted out front that says "Tin Town Neutral Zone - any fighting or stealing will be met with a sharp knife and a lifetime ban". You see a massive Orc out front, larger even than the one at the gates to the Kingdom. She holds a club in one hand a massive sword in the other, which does look to be the size of a knife compared to her. It is no suprise that order is maintained here. Your group reaches an agreement to enter. ${char.wizard.name} will radiate a calming aura, ${char.hunter.name} will do the talking, and the Warrior and Assassin will stand gaurd, watching for trouble. The Orc lets you in with a nod and a low growl for "No trouble". Inside you see other large Orcs similarly armed placed at intervals throughout the tent. There are three food stalls with various smells eminating from them. Your team choses the one that smells the best and gets in line. This place is unlike any other in Tin Town. There is a noisy buzz of converstation and people seem to be mostly at ease. You see tables where trade and games of chance are occuring and people playing instruments and singing. Once you have your food, greasy but tasty pies containing an unknown meat, you make your way through the tables looking for an opportunity for trade. You approach a table where a man sits at a table covered in goods. He seems to be trading based on some kind of wagering system. If your coin lands up you get a credit, if your coin lands down you lose your coin. Your team decides to wager for 3 credits worth of food and cloth.`,
    theWitch: `After a few days journey your band of warriors see the "Dead forest". The legends of this place say that even in the brightest of days, no light enters into it. Being the only route you can take to remain hidden from alerting the king to your presence, you make your way into the forest. Once you enter, the appearance of day turns to night. The sound of nature comes to a still silence. The wind that once passed through the air is now motionless. As you continue moving forward, a fog appears from underneath the your teams feet. The fog keeps getting thicker and higher up the further you move along. After a few hours of traveling and only hearing the sound of your own breathing and the footsteps you make as you walk, a voice comes out of the air and surrounds you. A single voice, yet it echos with many other voices within itself. ${char.wizard.name} knows that this voice contains the echoes of the poor souls that have been absorbed by a witch. You hear, "Who enters this forest that is my own? A Wizard and a Human Assassin, an Ogre and Elf. I have watched you enter into my realm and I have heard you walk on my ground. You will not be permitted to go any further." Your team explains their need to pass. That your journey is to kill the king. ${char.wizard.name} entices the witch further... "Being that the king has closed his walls to wandering and curious outsiders, you have been unable to feed off of any new souls. I felt the hunger as soon as we entered the forest. The stench of your hunger grew the deeper we got." The witch, knowing that she is unable to defeat a powerful wizard, acquiesces to your request. She has not had any guests for countless years, so for her amusement, she gives you a riddle. If answered correctly, she will cast a spell that will aid your team with defeating the king. As well as directions on how to get there. If you all answer correctly she will give ${char.wizard.name} her hideous and powerful staff`,
    theHydra: `Following the directions the witch has given, your surroundings slowly turn to a thick swampy land. The smell of the air is reminiscent of a freshly ended battle. The smell of death is too familiar to warriors like yourselves. Knowing now that this might have been a trap, you are too far along in your journey to turn back. As you move onward, the swamp ground becomes thicker and thicker, making it harder for you to move quickly. Finally, after climbing a 15ft mound of thick slippery mud, your group looks out into the distance. ${char.wizard.name} uses a farsight spell and can see a straight path to the village, visable only by the plumes of chimney smoke peaking out atop the dead trees that stretch a few more miles ahead of you. Now realizing that your journey is nearing its end, you climb down with enthusiasm.
    Suddenly, the ground starts moving beneath you. What seemed to be another 30ft mound starts to grow in size. It moves upward growing and growing, then splits into multiple heads. This is a Hydra! One of the most feared creatures that ever lived. The stories say they defeat all who face them. No one knows the true age of a hydra, but the legends stem from ancient scrolls, and they are rare indeed. The beast is so vicious that the Hydras 9 heads fight each other for the chance to be one of the first to taste your flesh.`,
    rebellion: `Weary from your battle with the Hydra your band of warriors trudges out of the swampy forrest. ${char.hunter.name} holds up what used to be a very nice bow and says "my bow has seen better days", ${char.assassin.name} replies "my body has seen better days!" As you approach the city, you see the castle from a distance. It's dark aura sends chills down your spine dispite being exhausted. A group of ragged villagers comes toward you looking only slightly less bedraggled than your team. You can tell even from a distance that these are not the kings men. They look too tired and hungry. You meet in the road and they verify that you are the heros they have heard tales of. They offer to take you to their camp site for the night to rest and share their meal. ${char.wizard.name} starts a conversation with their party leader, "We have just come from the forest where we had a run in with the fiercest Hydra..." The leader looks shocked, "And you survived??". When you get back to the camp word quickly spreads that you defeated the hydra and the whole camp comes forward with spare bandages, healing potions, and salves. You don't want to take more than you need because these people don't have much. You stay the night with the rebels and enjoy the feeling of being safe in a group and having a full belly. In the morning you ready yourselves to leave. A wrinkled old woman with cloudy eyes approches your group with a bow in her hands. She walks up to ${char.hunter.name} and says "My mother was half-elf and when I was a girl she taught me to enchant wood to make it strong. I noticed your bow has been broken. I am old and I do not have the powers I once had but I would like to try one last time to enchant this bow for you. If it works you have a very fine bow, if it doesn't at least you have a bow that isn't broken.`,
    cityAroundThePalace: 'Your band arrives to the city surrounding the palace with plans to meet the contact you were given when you first crossed through the kingdom\'s walls. However things never go exactly as planned… The kings guards are swarming the city and a group of mighty fighters like yourselves can’t just walk through the city unnoticed. You will have to go in disguise and hope that your contact will be able to recognize you.',
    hornedAnimal: `You approach an older building with a weathered sign swinging over the door. The wooden square features a white unicorn that looks a little more like a yellow donkey with a wizards hat than the magical creature the tavern was named for, but you figure you must be in the right place. Your group exchanges a familiar look that means “be prepared in case this is a trap” and you walk in. A woman behind the bar points you towards a table while loading a serving boy’s tray with pitchers of beer and piling bowls of stew and loaves of crusty bread on a second tray held by a young girl. You realize these must be her children because they all share the same bright red hair. The tavern is busy with workers coming in for an evening meal. Most of the patrons are younger, and look like skilled laborers… probably without families at home to share the meal. Wealthy enough to afford a meal at a tavern, but not well off enough to eat at one of the places frequented by merchants or guards. The small red haired girl arrives at your table and hands you bowls and bread in exchange for 5 coper coins a piece. She tells you that for two more her brother will fill your mugs and then scampers off. The soup is good despite being thin and the bread is hot and delicious. You begin to wonder if your contact will recognize you when another red head, this time a bearded giant, approaches your table. He warily addresses your group “You look like you’ve traveled a long way. Seems like there is a storm is on the horizon…” ${char.hunter.name} responds “Better a storm than a draught” and the man's face instantly relaxes. Your contact, Halbert, turns out to be the owner of the Horned Animal. He and his wife took it over when her father died and have been doing their best to keep the business going. He tells you that the tavern used to be busy all day long but now with the people growing more poor the only time they have clients is for dinner. His wife’s father was ill and couldn’t afford to get the care he needed despite having worked hard his whole life. Halbert says “We can’t keep letting the king get rich on the backs of the villagers while we starve or die from treatable maladies. Thank you for hearing our need, I want my children to have a chance at a life without suffering”. He leaves you a map of the palace complex including guard stations and servants entrances and wishes you luck. You notice on the map to the northeast of the palace a small x on the map with a note "Water Sprite". A few minutes later the boy comes to your table with wrapped packets for each of you “me ma made some sandwiches for yer travels” he squeaks and then turns and quickly disappears back behind the bar.`,
    wishingWell: `You sleep the night in Halbert's barn but are up with the roosters to get on the road. You leave the city on a small path headed northwest. Within 30 minutes of travel your band of warriors is out of site range of the city. Surrounded by the beautiful country side it is hard to remember why you are here. Little things break the illusion of peace - fields left fallow and growing weeds, bits of ground torn up and scraps of armor laying beside the road where travelers have been ambushed. ${char.wizard.name} reminds you all to keep a sharp eye for bandits. As the sun begins to set you crest a rise you have been climbing for over an hour. Before you there is a small valley with an unmarked well at the center. The well is walled by round stones, tumbling down in places and in general disrepair. Wells like this are generally upkept by travelers, but with the roads being more dangerous it has been left untended. You begin to clear away the ivy and weeds growing into the stone. ${char.warrior.name} places the fallen rocks back into the wall and ${char.hunter.name} packs mud in between them. ${char.assassin.name} removes debris and scum from the surface of the water, which is a few feet into the mouth of the well, and asks "So how do we summon the water sprite?" The Wizard replies "We do not summon her. We leave a gift and hope she will grace us with her presence." The Warrior looks confused, "What do we give her?" ${char.wizard.name} contemplates the question while walking around the repaired well. "Give me the vials you got from the troll." ${char.assassin.name} says "I thought that was some kind of potion." The Wizard explains "It is not really a potion, it is an essence distilled from the waters under the bridge. To us it would be much like drinking very clean water, but to a sprite, a spirit of the water it is like pure energy." You all pour your vial into the well and set out your bed rolls for the night beside the well. The wizard explains that if you are lucky the sprite will accept your gift and grant you a blessing.`,
    mageSmith: `You have almost reached the split point when you see a brawny dwarf trudging down the road towards you. He is cursing up a storm and you wonder if maybe you should duck out of the way to avoid him, but no sooner does that thought cross your mind than the little man hails your group. “You there! If you are going to visit that ungrateful worm that calls himself the king give him my kindest regards” this sentiment is followed by a particularly loud bout of flatulence. The crude man is wearing a leather apron and carrying a hammer almost as large as he is. He begins gesturing wildly with the hammer and cursing the king at the top of his lungs.`,
    theKingIntro: `Your warrior band is worn from your journey but ready to bring battle to the tyrant king. You approach the palace walls and ${char.hunter.name} sends the falcon to hover above the king’s palace, scoping out the surrounding area. As your team approaches the soaring, tall wooden doors, meant to keep out intruders from the castle ${char.warrior.name} bull rushes the doors smashing them apart at the hinges. With the entrance clear your team approaches, with all eyes set toward the king. Standing on the steps above you, he appears corpulent with mottled orange skin and just a few wispy hairs on his skull. The king declares “I’ve been expecting you!”`,
    theKing1: `The King calmly walking yet strong in stature approaches the group but keeping his distance at the top of his stairs. In a moment’s notice he raises his arms and casts his black magic of ice towards the group. Using his newfound staff, the ${char.wizard.name} casts a spell exclaiming “Protego!” which reflects the stream of freeze back towards the King. Missing but scorching his cloak as he dives in the other direction. Quickly realizing he has underestimated the warrior’s strengths; the King gathers himself and calmly approaches the warriors. Thinking he can outsmart the group, he declares “I have a riddle for you...”`,
    theKing2: `Your team is eager to spill the King's blood. He rapidly retreats into the castle, and you make haste do battle.`,
    theKing3: `Now that the magic of the King’s staff has been destroyed, he is forced to fight close range. ${char.warrior.name} sees an opportunity and rushes toward the King. The King braces himself and waits for the impact. A second before the impact, the King pivots out of the way and sends ${char.warrior.name} smashing straight into one of the castle’s solid stone pillars. ${char.hunter.name} leaps from the top balcony for a surprise attack, but the King raises his hand and grabs the hunter by the feet and smashes the elf to the ground, knocking ${char.hunter.name} unconscious. ${char.assassin.name} runs toward the king throwing poisoned daggers. The King catches one of the daggers mid-air and just as the assassin reaches the King, the assassins dagger is turned against them. ${char.assassin.name} falls to their knees knowing the poison alone would mean death. ${char.wizard.name}, in an outrage at seeing the last companion fall, summons the last power left to defeat the King. ${char.wizard.name} and the king run toward each other with full force. Just as ${char.wizard.name} is about to finish the spell, the King grabs the wizard by the throat and lifts them off the ground. “Now you all die...” The King squeezes his grip tighter and starts to turn ${char.wizard.name}’s neck. In an unexpected last gasp of life, ${char.assassin.name} pulls out the dagger placed by the king and rises up behind him to stab him from behind through the heart. ${char.assassin.name} and the King both fall to the ground, neither moving.`,
    gameOverWin: 'Thank you for playing our game. We hope you enjoyed the journey. Spencer, Michael, Sara, and Czarl',
    gameOverKing: `You let the kingdom down with your failure. Perhaps you can come back again in disguise when you train up a bit.`,
    gameOverHydra: `Your party has taken too much damage to continue on at this point. Perhaps you can retreat and heal up enough to come back and try to free the people another time.`,
    gameOverDeath: `A member of your party has perished and you will be unable to continue without them. Perhaps you can see your way past the pain of losing your comrade to come back and try to free the people another time.`,
    ironForge: `You have been walking the southern road for over a day when you come upon a small village. The village seems to have sprouted up around a large smithy and you can hear the sound of a hammer repeatedly striking metal. The air is heavy with the smell of smoke, an acrid metalic smell, and another unidentifiable earthy odor. You pass through the village and try to hail a few of the inhabitants but they all seem to be in a hurry and won't talk to you other than to nod. Making your way towards the large smithy seems like the right choice, hopefully you will be able to repair and replace damaged armor. As you approach the building you see clouds of black smoke billowing from the chimney and escaping from the open side of the structure. There are 3 rough looking characters hanging around the place looking well armed and well fed. The source of the hammering is revealed to be a massive human man with forearms the size of ${char.warrior.name}'s neck. The hammering man is wearing a leather apron and a white shirt stained with soot and sweat. As you walk into the smithy he looks up with a scowl and then immediately goes back to his work, ignoring you. One of the idle men steps forward to intercept your group and says "Well we don't see too many strangers in these parts... and we like it that way". You hoped for a warmer reception. ${char.wizard.name}, ever the peace-maker replies "We come in search of repairs for our armor and possibly some food supplies if your village has any to spare." The speaker answers "If you have gold we can repair your armor, but the King's coin is no good here." This time ${char.warrior.name} speaks up, "We only have outland coins, but they are gold." "Aye, that'll do", the man replies. Finally the glowering blacksmith acknowledges you, "You may wait in the village for me to repair your armor, but don't distract my villagers... they have work to do." You get the sense that this man is in charge here. Your group tells him you will purchase some food but not bother anyone unnecessarily. You leave your armor and head away from the smithy. ${char.hunter.name} says, "Does anyone else think that was wierd?" ${char.assassin.name} answers "You mean the way we had to make it through the bully-boys to talk to the 'boss'?" The hunter responds "That and the way he referred the the people here as HIS villagers". As you go in search of food you decide to check in with the villagers a little.`,
    theBoisterousBaker: `You approach the house with the red door and ${char.warrior.name} takes the lead, lured in by the smell of fresh bread. The hungry Ogre opens the door and bellows a hello. The site of an Ogre walking through the door would scare a lot of people but the man standing at the counter holding a rolling pin seems overjoyed. "Welcome, welcome, my fine friends. Please come in to my shop!" This baker is the first person in the village that does not seem afraid to talk to you. ${char.warrior.name} eagerly approaches the counter and starts pointing at various loaves in the display case. ${char.wizard.name} puts a calming hand on the warriors arm and says "Let's start with one loaf and go from there." The Ogre looks a little disappointed but agrees. The baker laughs and says "Don't worry my friend, I will cut some samples for you to try. It isn't often that I get to serve customers from outside the village!" The baker cuts several slices from various loaves and sets out a crock of butter. He stops suddenly and says "These are samples free of charge, but I have to warn you that I can not accept the King's coin as payment. I hope you have other currency to shop with." With a mouth full of hot buttered bread ${char.warrior.name} assures the baker that you have "lots of gold to buy bread". ${char.assassin.name} laughs and with an eye roll says "We certainly do not have 'lots of gold' but we do have out of kingdom coin, and we are in the market for a good supply of bread and any other food stuffs you have that will travel." The baker breaks out in a wide grin and replies "Well in that case I am at your service!" While you sample different breads and spiced fruit preserves that the baker makes, you casually make conversation about the village. The baker seems very free with his words and tells you that the blacksmith is the law in town and uses his gang to keep order in the village but also keeps the monsters away for miles. "You didn't hear that from me though", he says "We aren't encouraged to talk to outsiders or spread the village business." ${char.wizard.name} asks "So why is the blacksmith the one in charge?" The baker tells you a story that sounds like a fairytale "There was a lost sword, a King Maker sword, that will one day declare the rightful ruler of the land. The blacksmith claims he has the sword... That he is the heir to the throne. He makes the village swear an oath to him every new moon and call him king. I guess it's not so bad though because he keeps the King's guard away and we don't have to pay taxes to the palace. Just to the village. You didn't hear that from me though." With your bags full of bread, travel bars, and preserved fruit you thank the baker, who seems as happy for the conversation as the coin.`,
    theShepherdsHouse: `You approach the house on the end of the road. It is a small older cottage a straw roof. You don't see any sheep but you knock anyway. A young girl with braids answers the door and steps back when she sees the four of you standing on the porch. "Mom!" she yells, and flees back into the cottage. A few seconds later a woman, who looks to be her mother comes to the door with a sock and darning needle in her hands. She looks apprehensive but asks "Can I help you?" This time you immediately start by explaining that the blacksmith authorized your supply search. ${char.wizard.name} puts on his most soothing tone, perhaps using a bit of a charm, and tells her "We were just hoping to buy some cloth suitable for bandages". "Well we have no shortage of wool" she says. "I can give you a fair price for some undyed cloth, I can't take the King's coin though, so I hope you have something else." The wizard assures her that you have other currency, but asks "Why doesn't your village take the King's coin?" The woman replies "The blacksmith won't allow anything to be sold or purchased with the King's gold, he likes to pretend we live outside of the kingdom. Won't pay taxes or let any guards in neither." ${char.assassin.name} asks "How does he get away with that? The guards don't demand taxes from you?" She answers "Well, the blacksmith told them we won't pay. He and his gang of louts ran 'em off, and I guess we are too small a village to put much effort into." ${char.wizard.name} speaks up, again with his soothing tone, to inquire about the sheep "Where does your family keep the sheep? We didn't see them as we came up, and I can't imagine it is safe for them to range far." She tells you that the blacksmith and his gang keep the land safe for three miles surrounding the village on all sides. Her husband and son can take the sheep out without worrying about monsters picking them off. ${char.assassin.name} has one last question "Why does the blacksmith hate the King so much? Not that there isn't a valid reason, but this seems personal." The Shepherdess tells you "Well there is a story around here, and none of us dares argue it... The Smith family has a sword, it is mounted above the forge in the smithy. It is a mighty broadsword made of the strongest steel. It is said that only the true King of the land can wield it. Every new moon the blacksmith comes into the village square with the sword and makes us all bend a knee to acknowledge his rightful claim to the throne. We are afraid to anger him, his wrath can be great. Now I am not saying he should be the king, but he does alright here... He keeps the monsters away and we all get enough to eat, which is more than I can say for most places, even if he is a bit controlling of the village." The woman looks shocked, like she just realized she said too much, and rushes to get your cloth so you can leave.`,
    backToTheSmithy: `After a few hours of tending to your packs and reorganizing your stock you return to the smithy, with the newly purchased supplies stowed away, to get your armor. Walking back into the shop you immediately see the giant sword and wonder how you missed it the first time you were in the building. This time the blacksmith is alone, without his followers present. You recieve your repaired armor back, noticing the good quality of the work. If nothing else, this blacksmith is good at his craft. He asks you "I expect you didn't interupt my villagers in their duties?". ${char.wizard.name} replies, "Certainly not, thank you for the hospitality of your village." The blacksmith looks unsure of how to take that last comment but nods. You pay for the repairs and are preparing to leave when you get the idea to ask the blacksmith about the sword.`,
    theKingMaker: `Gripping the hilt in his meaty hand you can see that most people would not be able to hold it. The grip is large and the sword is as tall as the wizard. He looks down proudly at the sword in his hand and begins the story. "This sword was made in my great great grandfathers time by a man who was a Mage-Smith for the King of this land. The kingdom was at war and the King needed a fine sword to protect him in battle. Before it could be completed the King was slain. He had no children and left the land without a ruler. The Mage-Smith melted the King's crown into the steel of the sword and wove many spells and enchantments into the forging. The new purpose of the blade was to declare the rightful ruler of the Kingdom. The sword was being transported to the palace where every knight in the kingdom had been invited to try and draw the sword. The one to draw the blade would be declared the new king. While in transport the horses driving the wagon were spooked and ran off the road landing the sword and it's maker in the river. The Mage-Smith was drowned and the blade lost. It was found several years later by my great grandfather who pulled it from the riverbed. By that time a new king had been crowned and the tale of the king's blade supressed by the new regime. My ancestor kept the blade and it has been passed down in my family for generations to the oldest son able to draw the blade each generation. So as you can see I am the rightful king. The man on the throne is an imposter and eventually I will deal with him." The blacksmith really warmed to the topic. This is the most you have heard him talk since you entered the village.`,
    theRingAndTheRose: `He seems conflicted, maybe even angered that he is not the first to attempt to take on the King. You see a range of emotions wash over his face, finally landing on resolve. "I have two very special items I may be willing to give you for your quest, if they will have you" he says. He retreats into the shop and opens a locked cabinet set into the stone wall of the forge. He pulls out a small box and continues "These items were also found with the blade but I am unable to use them. They were not made for a king" suprised at how fully he buys into the vision of himself as the king you are nonetheless intrigued by what is waiting in the box. The blacksmith opens the box to reveal two treasures. A simple gold ring, of a relatively small diameter, and a silver amulet with an intricately carved rose on the face. Only the rightful users of these items will be able to handle them. The ring will fit the first finger of the right hand of it's owner, and the locket can only be opened by one wise enough to use what is inside it.`,
