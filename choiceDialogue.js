  theOrcLordRoll1: `${char.warrior.name} runs in and slams directly into the Orc Lord trying to keep him busy while ${char.assassin.name} creeps up behind him preparing to cut in to the backs of his knees when the moment is right. The Orc seems to be smarter than he looks because he is on to your tactic and backs up against the wall where ${char.assassin.name} will not be able to get behind him. With the sun in your eyes ${char.wizard.name} and ${char.hunter.name} are not able to successfully put up an attack or defense. Things begin to go sideways and ${char.warrior.name} calls for ${char.assassin.name} to fallback. ${char.assassin.name} throws down vanishing powder and with the explosion your team makes a run for it. You have suffered injuries and will have to find another way into the kingdom.`,

The monster begins furiously bellowing and stumbles forward while ${char.assassin.name} takes the opportunity to hamstring the foe, and ${char.warrior.name} finishes him off with a few powerful blows to the nose. Your team prevails but not without damages. You enter the kingdom over the body of your conquered enemy.`,

Your team prevails with very little in the way of damage and you enter through the gates of the kingdom.`,
  theWoodsmanLuck1: `The woodsman's family is clearly very poor and has nothing to give you for your help.`,
  theWoodsmanLuck2: 'Luck seems to be with you today. The wife of the woodsman is grateful for your help and gives you a healing salve she makes from local plants.',
  theVillageChoices1: `Talon is thrilled you will help "Wonderful, the families that still remain will be happy to hear that there is a chance they will be safe. The path is along the fields heading south. You will come upon a cliff that falls 50ft down into a cavern. This is where the Goblin lives. The beast has a heightened sense of smell, so you are able to lure him out with the scent of a fresh wound. Any amount of blood will do for this creature. Please return to the village to let us know of your missions success."`,
  theVillageChoices2: `Talon looks regretful but says "I understand, I should not have asked you to stray off of your quest. The path to continue your journey is along the paved roads heading north. It is still before noon, so the path has a bit of an infestation problem. It is usually safer to go after the sun is at its highest peak. Which is when the creatures hide from the heat. I must confess, that of course is the least of your problems... There is a bridge that lays between here and your destination. The only people to cross are the Kings guards. The few who have set out to the bridge have ever returned. Farewell friends and good luck."`,
  theGoblinRolls1: `As you charge toward the group of monsters, the Goblins strike effortlessly with their dogslicers dripping a foul green poison. One sends ${char.warrior.name} flying back to the village. The villagers are shocked to see one of their heroes now injured. It’s up to the rest of you to finish the battle. ${char.assassin.name} prepares to attack as a pair of Goblins come from behind and rain blow after blow down leaving one less member of your team standing. ${char.wizard.name} and ${char.hunter.name} realize that with the two close range fighters out of the battle they will not be able to defeat the goblins. ${char.wizard.name} creates a 20 foot-radius sphere of thick fog that blinds the Goblins. ${char.hunter.name} picks up ${char.assassin.name} and returns back to the village under cover of the fog. The Woodsman says "It’s unfortunate that you were not able to defeat the Goblins but do not worry, we’ve prepared for this. We appricate that you tried but you were clearly out numbered. Rest here tonight. Hopefully you will defeat the King and evil creatures like this will no longer be able to flourish in our land`,
  theGoblinRolls2: `As ${char.warrior.name} impulsively charges towards the group of Goblins, one strikes at him with a dogslicer dripping a foul green poison which he narrowly evades. The Assasin tries to slash one of them but fails, ${char.assassin.name}'s knives are useless as the Goblin is able to stop them before they touch his skin. As soon as that becomes apparent, your group knews they will not able to win this battle with simple combat. Fortunately, ${char.wizard.name} has an idea. The Wizard will casts an Illusion spell that makes it appear as though pots full of gold have appeared on the ground before you. When the Goblins see the gold, their eyes shimmer with greed for the treasure. ${char.wizard.name} silently mouths, "Go!" to ${char.assassin.name} who moves through the mesmerized goblins, slicing them one by one. The Warrior, though seriously injured, gets up and with all remaining strength, helps the Assasin. Soon, only one Goblin is left. This Goblin gives the impression of being the leader of the group. Together, ${char.warrior.name} and ${char.assassin.name}'s weapons pierce its chest.
  The villagers cheer as the last Goblin falls. Though your group has been injured, you are relieved that from now on, no one will be taking the Village harvest and everyone will begin to live in peace. The village is so grateful for your help that they happily offer you healing supplies`,
  theGoblinRolls3: `Since your team is familiar with Goblins, and know their weakness, you’ve devised a quick plan for taking on the harvest raiders. Your band of warriors is confident that it will work because, after all greed makes anyone blind and foolish, and makes them easy prey for death. ${char.wizard.name} casts an Illusion spell that makes it appear as though pots full of gold have appeared before you. When the Goblins see the gold, their eyes shimmer with greed for the treasure. Now that they’re distracted by the spell, ${char.assassin.name} and ${char.warrior.name} immediately run towards them and slit their bodies open one by one. Soon only one Goblin is left. It gives the impression of being the leader of the group. Together, ${char.warrior.name} and ${char.assassin.name}'s weapons pierce its chest.
  The villagers cheer as the last Goblin falls. Though your group has been injured, you are relieved that from now on, no one will be taking the Village harvest and everyone will begin to live in peace. The village is so grateful for your help that they happily offer you healing supplies`,
  theTrollRolls1: `While ${char.warrior.name} is massive in their own right, they are dwarfed by the behemoth of the Troll standing before your team. ${char.warrior.name} makes the first move and lunges at the massive Troll. Reaching back, swinging across his body, the Troll swipes ${char.warrior.name} sending them sliding. Startled by the ease at which the Troll manhandled ${char.warrior.name}, ${char.assassin.name} and ${char.hunter.name} quickly spring into action, each taking a side to attack. While big the Troll may be, he does not move well, ${char.assassin.name} and ${char.hunter.name} being small and shifty each take a side running around to the legs of the Troll. Experiencing a feeling like a mosquito bite, the Troll looks down and sees his attackers, he quickly reaches back plucking each one in a fist-full; then tosses them aside next to ${char.warrior.name} who is still dazed from his hit. Quickly, knowing they stand no chance with the now angry giant, ${char.wizard.name} retreats behind a tree, hoping to use sense and wit, and a small spell, to talk some reason into the Troll so he will let your group pass with peace. Reluctantly the Troll decides to let your group by. He warns you that what you will encounter ahead may not be as kind as he is. As you cross the bridge ${char.hunter.name} sees a hawk tied down to the rail of the bridge. ${char.hunter.name} quickly releases the bird. It would be good to have a raptor as an extra pair of eyes in the sky for their journey ahead.`,

Startled by the ease at which the Troll manhandled ${char.warrior.name}, ${char.assassin.name} and ${char.hunter.name} quickly spring into action, each taking a side to attack. Not moving swiftly, the Troll stumbles over himself in an attempt to locate the dual attack. This gives enough time for ${char.warrior.name} to recover and lock arms with the Troll. At a stalemate in strength, ${char.wizard.name} reluctantly casts a spell towards the two, knocking them both to the ground, into a temporary state of paralysis. After a while, they awake from their state. Not conceding defeat but willing to let the group pass, the Troll gathers himself. He warns of the dangers ahead in the passage toward the King’s palace. As a peace offering the Troll offers ${char.hunter.name} a trusty falcon to give you eyes in the sky for your journey ahead.`,

With a lack of athleticism, the Troll struggles to gather himself, this gives an opportunity for the wizard to sit back and use magic. Belting out in a strong wise voice, ${char.wizard.name} declares a spell of “Incarcerous!”. In a moments notice the Troll is wiggling, bound up on the floor in a silver rope. Conceding quickly, the Troll begs for his release. In exchange for his freedom, he gifts a falcon to ${char.hunter.name} as a pair of eyes in the sky. He warns your group that what they will encounter ahead may not be as kind as him.`,
  forkInTheRoad1: `You come to a consensus that even though it takes you out of the way you need to find a market that will be large enough for you to replenish food, bandages, and clothing. You head north.`,
  forkInTheRoad2: `The group votes to head south. It is smarter to stay on track to your destination. If you can find even a small town with a forge and a blacksmith that will go a long way towards preparing you for the King.`,
  theMerchantRiddle1: `"I am sorry, you did not answer correctly. I wish I could help but I have no choice" the Merchant says and moves away`,
  theMerchantRiddle2: `"You are correct! The king has no law about me giving gifts so I would like to give you a gift I hope will help you on your quest."`,
  theMerchantRiddle3: `"I am sorry, very few of you answered correctly. Otherwise my prizes could have been greater."`,
  theMerchantRiddle4: `"More than half of you answered correctly! You are a very smart group and I know you will defeat that evil king!"`,
  tinTownChoices1: `The woman seems unwilling to say anything else so you thank her for he time and head further down the path to seek supplies.`,
  tinTownChoices2: `You decide to see if she can give you any more information before moving on.`,
  tinTownChoices3: `You've already lost time and are very low on supplies. You can't afford to waste any more wandering through this place. There is clearly nothing they have to part with and plenty of oportunities for trouble. You thank her for her time and head out on to the road again.`,
  curiosityChoices1: `You need supplies or you won't make it any further. You will have to be on guard for any looking to take advantage of outsiders. Your group begins to head deeper into the Tin Town`,

  theWitchRiddle1: 'Hahaha, of course a stupid mortal like you could not answer a simple question.',
  theWitchRiddle2: 'You clever mortal... You are the first to ever correctly answer my riddle.',
  theWitchRiddle3: 'You are not as smart as you think you are at least half of you answered my riddle incorrectly. You will have to be very careful with the king, if you make it that far! Keep moving west until you get to the swamp. After you pass the swamp land you will make it out to the village.',
  theWitchRiddle4: 'Well, well... You are not as foolish as you look. Let us see if you are smart enough to stay alive. Keep moving west until you get to the swamp. After you pass the swamp land you will make it out to the village.',
  theHydraRolls1: `One of the heads seems to win the fight with the other 8 because it is the first to strike out towards you. ${char.wizard.name} and ${char.hunter.name} are too close to the battle to be able to execute a ranged attack and are forced into hand to hand contact with the the rest of the group. Your group decapitates one of the snapping heads but there are many more coming at you. With one down you are still out numbered. The four of you are now standing back to back, each person fighting off two at a time. ${char.assassin.name} tries unsuccessfully to use blinding powder in the creatures eyes, to no effect. Finally ${char.warrior.name} takes one of the heads down and you hear a bloodcurdling keen behind you which makes you think a mortal wound may have been inflicted on another long neck. One of your comrades cry out and you’ve all taken pretty serious wounds at this point. ${char.wizard.name} signals a retreat and you begin moving as a group into the tree-line where you hope the hydra will not be able to follow. You have to fight for every step but eventually you make it to the safety of the trees. You will not be able to cross the swamp, you will be lucky if you all even survive the night.`,

One of your comrades cry out and you’ve all taken pretty serious wounds at this point. ${char.wizard.name} and ${char.warrior.name} begin working out a routine where the warrior disorients the head by bashing it with his mace and the wizard sends hot white flames at the neck. This works twice before the hydra catches on and changes it’s tactics. ${char.assassin.name} and ${char.hunter.name} have a different strategy. The hunter calls their beautiful hunting falcon down on one of the heads. The monster looks up trying to snap at the bird while the assassin slices through its leathery neck. The hydra is badly injured and so are you. The fighting slows down and cautiously the hydra begins to retreat, not wanting to lose any more heads. You are able to make it out of the swamp but your group has sustained massive injuries, and you will need to find help soon.`,
  theHydraRolls3: `One of the heads seems to win the fight with the other 8 because it is the first to strike out towards you. ${char.wizard.name} and ${char.hunter.name} make a rapid retreat so that they will be able to fight at a distance that is more effective for them. Your group decapitates one of the snapping heads but there are many more coming at you. With one down you are still out numbered. ${char.wizard.name} and ${char.hunter.name} begin shooting arrows, magical and regular, at the creature’s remaining heads which serves to distract them while ${char.assassin.name} and ${char.warrior.name} rush in to savage the neck and body. In a risky maneuver the assassin rushes in and plunges a long narrow sword deep into the creatures chest. The blade sticks and two of the heads roar in pain and snake down to bite at ${char.assassin.name}, who roles quickly under the creatures legs, avoiding the teeth but being stepped on in the process. ${char.warrior.name} flies at the hydra’s body slamming the sword the rest of the way into the monster’s chest and through it’s heart. All remaining heads let out a horrible keening wail as the hydra collapses and falls still. You have defeated the monster, but not unscathed.`,
  rebellionLuck1: `Unfortunatly luck is not with you today. The old woman looks out with sorrow etched on her face and ${char.hunter.name} assures her that a working bow is more than we even hoped for.`,
  rebellionLuck2: `The old woman turns her face up with a smile. "It has worked" she says and hands ${char.hunter.name} the bow. "This is more than we could have ever hoped for, thank you" ${char.wizard.name} says taking her hands, "thank you"`,
  cityChoices1: `${char.assassin.name} says “I’ll be the contortionist!”, ${char.warrior.name} “I guess that makes me the strongman”, ${char.wizard.name} “I have tons of great illusions!”, and ${char.hunter.name} “who wants to volunteer to let me throw daggers at them??” You all laugh, but it is half from amusement and half due to heightened nerves. You know you are getting close to confronting the king and everything will have to go right for you to succeed. You help each other to create shabby costumes from random clothing items each person has in their bags. “Cirque du Folie” enters the city gates with a nod from the guard and instructions to register with the performers guild before you can begin doing shows. You had been instructed to meet your contact at a tavern called the “Horned Animal” where he will greet you with a code phrase. Your costumes seem to be working because not a single guard that passes your group even looks at you twice.`,
  cityChoices2: `${char.hunter.name} says “I knew this lute was going to come in handy! You all said I was stupid for carrying it around all this time! ${char.warrior.name} you’re good at hitting things, go find something you can use as a drum.” Looks like ${char.assassin.name} and ${char.wizard.name} will be singing for their supper. You disguise your weapons to look like wrapped musical instruments and make your way to the city gates. The gate guard lets you through with instructions to register with the performers guild before you can begin doing shows. You had been instructed to meet your contact at a tavern called the “Horned Animal” where he will greet you with a code phrase. Your guise of musicians seem to be working because not a single guard that passes your group even looks at you twice.`,
  cityChoices3: `${char.wizard.name} says “I have some pigment with me that will work as dye for our cloaks. I can make them all a dark brown so we will pass for a band of traveling monks.” ${char.assassin.name} goes out to collect grasses from the surrounding area to stuff under the cloaks and ${char.hunter.name} begins braiding rope to use as belts. When the cloaks have dried enough in the sun to wear you help each other tie your cloaks around you like robes and stuff them with grasses to disguise the shape of your weapons. Now you look like a group of pudgy monks, you hope this will be convincing to the gate guards. ${char.wizard.name} does the talking as you meet the guard. The rest of you have taken a “vow of silence” and keep your heads bowed as you are motioned through. The burly guard tells your group where to find a clean inn that welcomes visiting clergy and (wizard) thanks him. You had been instructed to meet your contact at a tavern called the “Horned Animal” where he will greet you with a code phrase. Your “holy robes” seem to be working because not a single guard that passes your group even looks at you twice.`,
  hornedAnimalChoices1: `You don't have much extra time but you all decide it is worth the detour if your could get the blessing of a Water Sprite. Perhaps collect some healing water for the fight ahead...`,
  hornedAnimalChoices2: `You decide there isn't time to go looking for a Water Sprite. Early the next morning your team packs up and stashes everything you don’t need for your mission in Halbert’s barn. The cow moo’s in surprise at having unknown guests, but continues chewing her hay before long. If you survive you will be able to come back and get your packs. If you don’t return Halbert has been instructed to turn them in to the city guard as suspicious “lost and found” so he will not be accused of aiding you. You plan to split up about half way to the palace and approach from different directions.`,
  mageSmithChoices1: `${char.hunter.name} tries to motion the dwarf to speak quietly, but this seems only to enrage him more. His volume begins to increase and ${char.assassin.name} does the only logical thing, blows sleeping powder in his face. This doesn’t force him into sleep, as dwarves are very resistant to these types of drugs but he does seem to become much more relaxed and his eyes have a slightly glazed quality. You all usher the little man into a side alley before the guards come to check out the noise. The dwarf seems unable to speak but ${char.wizard.name} talks to him in a coaxing voice and he begins to slowly tell his tale. “I was the kings personal smith. I make very special weapons, because you see not only am I a smith, I am also a mage. My people have long studied the art of working enchantments into metal as we strike it and the king sent to my people asking for the greatest Mage-Smith we could offer. My work is renowned and I was honored to be chosen by my tribe to come to the palace and craft a blade for the king. Only when I arrived did I begin to see the reality of this request. The king did not want to let me do my work. He began demanding certain qualities and powers of the sword. I tried to tell him that it doesn’t work that way. The metal has a spirit of its own and that determines what attributes the metal will hold when it is formed. The king fired me and threw me out of the palace. I have never been so insulted! The man is an infant and I wouldn’t want one of my masterpieces in his hands anyway!” It seems risky to trust a stranger but this dwarf seems convincingly opposed to the king, so you tell him of your quest. He says “The king is very powerful and he surrounds himself with people who encourage his ego and increase his strength. You will have a hard time defeating him but I will gift you the blade he did not want.” The dwarf pulls a wrapped sword off his back that you didn’t notice until now. “This sword holds many attributes. One of which is the power of Invisibility. It makes itself invisible, and when you pull it the bearer and any they touch become invisible as well. The king wishes only to be seen. It’s second attribute is the power of Grace, when holding this blade the fighter will become more agile and fluid. The king did not think this power masculine enough for his sword. It has some other smaller attributes but those are the main two.” You all look upon the blade with awe, never have you seen such a powerful weapon. ${char.wizard.name} says, “Thank you Sir Mage-Smith, you are truly a master at your art and powerful sorcerer. A blade of this majesty will surely turn the tides for us” The dwarf simply nods, hands ${char.assassin.name} the blade and turns to walk away. You stare after him surprised that he has become so calm when he suddenly turns and growls “Tell him Athgar sent you when you cut his throat”. That seems more like the dwarf you have come to know`,
  mageSmithChoices2: `The only way to break into the dwarfs temper tantrum will be an equally explosive response. ${char.warrior.name} lets loose a mighty roar, leaving everyone silent, and your group rushes the little man into a side alley before the guards come to check out the noise.

  mageSmithChoices3: `You itch your ear, code for “time to hit the road” and your comrades all give a subtle nod. You break off, some going left, and the others going right, leaving the angry dwarf shouting in the street. Just in time too! A storm of guards goes thundering past you towards the noise. He might have helped you after all. Now all the guards between you and the palace will have their hands full. As the guards haul the man past you a package you hadn’t noticed before falls from the mans back. ${char.assassin.name} picks it up and unwraps the long, thin, item to discover a beautiful sword. When ${char.assassin.name} grasps the hilt they become invisible! This will be a powerful weapon to have against the king.`,
  theKing1Riddle1: 'The King looks at you with undisguised glee. Your answer is incorrect.',
  theKing1Riddle2: 'The King looks at you with astonishment. Your answer was correct.',

  theKing2Rolls1: `The King turns his back and takes a couple of steps away from you. He is using a tall dark wooden staff that houses a bright red gem at the top to support him walking. In the blink of an eye, he turns and emits a stream of fire from his staff and directs it towards the your group. Jumping out of the way ${char.assassin.name} throws a dagger toward the King. Having to dodge the dagger, the king is forced to stop his attack. ${char.warrior.name} raises both fists in the air and smashes the ground, sending debris and chunks of broken earth hurling upward toward the King. The King is knocked off his feet by the blast. Immediately he uses his staff to raise him into the air and creates a forcefield around him. ${char.hunter.name} takes their bow and fires an arrow straight towards the King, but it does no damage, as it is deflected by the shield. As the elf reloads the heirloom bow, ${char.wizard.name} combats the Kings spell with their own. ${char.wizard.name} can only break through the spell for a few seconds as the Kings powers are too strong. ${char.hunter.name} sees that the wizard is about to let go of the spell, and releases an arrow through the air. Just as the arrow is about to hit the King, ${char.wizard.name} falls to the floor and the Kings shield comes back up in time to stop the arrow from hitting him. The King then raises his staff and emits a wave that rips a hole into the roof of the castle, sending large boulders crashing down on you and the rest of the warriors. Crushed by the rubble, the fight is over. The King prevails!`,

  theKing3Rolls1: `Unfortunately you all have died in your confrontation with the evil King. Luck is with the kingdom though because the King lay dead beside you. You will never know the taste of victory but songs will be written for your bravery`,
  theKing3Rolls2: `Unfortunately half of your party was killed in the battle. ${char.hunter.name} was slain by the King mid-way through the fight, and ${char.assassin.name} died striking the final blow that brought the King down. ${char.wizard.name} helps revive ${char.warrior.name} and the two of your remaining band leave the castle to seek the safety of the rebellion.
